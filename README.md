🚀 Start UI [native] is a opinionated [Expo](https://expo.dev/) starter repository created & maintained by the [BearStudio Team](https://www.bearstudio.fr/team) and other contributors.
It represents our team's up-to-date stack that we use when creating React Native apps for our clients.

This starter is oriented to use Expo with Expo EAS features to have fully access to native code.

## Create a EAS development build

⚠️ To do only if no development build on date with native code is available

```bash
# ios
eas build --profile development --platform ios
# android
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

---

## Build native locally

If you want to build locally the application (with native layer) follow those steps :

### Android

You need to install Android Studio and Android SDK on your computer to be able to build locally the application
without using EAS build.

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

The application will start on your device or on an android simulator.

### iOS

You need to install XCode on your Mac to be able to build locally the application
without using EAS build.

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

The application will start on your device or on an iOS simulator.
